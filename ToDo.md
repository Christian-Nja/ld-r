# TODO list

-   analyze faceted browser to understand if you can integrate its facet with PatternInstance visualizations

-   load multiple instance at the same time
-   add geocoding possibility from address information if lat/long are not in the KG (TimeIndexedTypedLocationView)
-   decide interaction you load an instance. Example: Collection is loaded: you see the list of resources, onClick load the instance (you need to pass a onResourceClick to ld-ui-react visualizations)
-   when all the data required for an instance visualization are not in the KG, land on generic default ones by LD-R
